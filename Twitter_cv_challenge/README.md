task
taking the above images as the training set, output the coordinates for the bounding boxes contain the twitter “following button”

i.e. output is a list of arrays containing the bounding boxes of the following buttons for each picture:

[ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax]
for validation, i suggest keeping 1 picture away from the training data then using it as the validation image

helpful resources

this challenge is completely open ended! feel free to use whatever tools / frameworks works best for you. here are some tips you can use (but don’t need to!)

i suggest doing this challenge using a pre-trained model with weights already tuned, this process called transfer learning allows you to get great results with less input data, and this approach doesn’t require much computing / gpu resources

using a jupyter notebook will help though is not necessary, google colab may also be a good resource

deliverable

once you’ve achieved the result in the “task” section, record a video demonstrating the running of your code and the resulting output. then share your code in whichever way you prefer! it can be a link, a github repo, zip file, etc.
