    "In the previous frequentist mini-projects, you did frequentist calculations to perform inference from a sample of data. Such inference relies on theory largely developed from the 19th-Century onwards that is subject to certain assumptions or theoretical limits. These are fine if those assumptions hold for the particular case you're working on, and what you want to do has a known theoretical distribution (for example the mean of a sampling distribution that we looked at in the previous mini-project.)"

    "In this mini-project, you'll use the same medical charge data you used in the frequentist inference mini-project, but this time you'll make inferences about the population using bootstrapping (ie. simulating repeated re-runs of an experiment.) If frequentism is about using assumptions and theoretical results to calculate what we expect to happen were an experiment to be run again and again and again, then bootstrapping is about using computing power to essentially re-run the sample draw again and again and again to see what actually happens."

    "* the _z_-statistic\n",
    "* the _t_-statistic\n",
    "* the difference and relationship between the two\n",
    "* the Central Limit Theorem, its assumptions and consequences\n",
    "* how to estimate the population mean and standard deviation from a sample\n",
    "* the concept of a sampling distribution of a test statistic, particularly for the mean\n",
    "* how to combine these concepts to calculate confidence intervals and p-values\n",

If this fails to reach the level of our _pre-specified_ $\\alpha$, we decide the null hypothesis is sufficiently unlikely to be true and thus reject it.

    "* calculated the same confidence interval lower limit as you did previously\n",
    "* tested the assumption that the variances of the two groups (insured vs. non-insured) were equal - something a bit harder to do using the frequentist method because of the nature of the sampling distribution for variance\n",
    "* calculated the p-value for the difference between the means of the two groups and compared with the result obtained using the previous frequentist approach\n",

    "You are now well equipped to apply the bootstrap approach to a wide variety of problems. Just think about what conditions you wish to recreate in your simulated reruns."
