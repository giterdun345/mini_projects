    "# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

    "On this test I used a z statistic to check the null hypothesis. After checking to see if the Central Limit Theorem could be applied, I created hypotheses and decided on a significance level. The proportion of callbacks relative to race was calculated and used by subtracting the proportions to find the difference and adding the variance to calculate the standard deviation.  Once the z-score was calculated, a p-value was then calculated and comapred to the significance level defined in the first steps. Also, to get a good picture of how the distribution looked, I calculated a confidence interval to compare the difference of means. Based on the p-value and the range of the confidence level, it was decided that the null hypothesis was rejected supporting the claim that a black sounding name recieves less callbacks than a white sounding name. The statistics show that there is a correlation between callbacks relative to a race related name. This can be established with a confidence level of 95%. In other words, the likelyhood of recieving a callback if your name sounds black is decreased compared to a callback if your name sounded white. "
